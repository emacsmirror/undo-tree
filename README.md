The reasons I maintain this fork are that the upstream and GNU ELPA versions
diverged in the past, upstream does not respond to requests, and there are many
compile warnings.

At this time I would not begin mirroring this fork on the Emacsmirror, but since
I am already doing that, I am sticking to it for the time being.
